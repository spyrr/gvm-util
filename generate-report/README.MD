This tool makes CSV files to one excel file and generates a xlsm file based on template.xlsm file.

- CSV files: downloaded results from OpenVAS(GVM) results

As you can see, the template file includes 2 sheets. One of them is "rawdata"
and another one is "Viewer".

![rawdata sheet](./screenshot/template-rawdata.jpg "rawdata sheet")
![viewer sheet](./screenshot/template-viewer.jpg "Viewer sheet")

And this xlsm file includes some VB Macro scripts like below.

* There is no malformed code. VB script was used only to show the data that you selected on rawdata sheet, in viewer sheet.
